# Digital Badge (TypeScript / TSX)

This repository was originally JavaScript. This README contains instructions to run the TypeScript-converted code.

- Install dependencies:
  npm install

- Run locally:
  npm start

- Build:
  npm run build

Notes:
- Source files live in /src (App.tsx, index.tsx, styles).
- If you used a custom App.js implementation, merge your component logic into src/App.tsx.
- If the project was created with Create React App, you can also run:
  npx create-react-app . --template typescript
  then copy custom source files into src/.
